                        have previously pursued studies at Bicol University Polangui Campus, 
                        specializing in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am 
                        currently in search of employment opportunities wherein I can 
                        effectively apply the knowledge and skills acquired during my 
                        academic journey for ongoing personal and professional development. 
                        My objective is to contribute to the enhancement of any organization I 
                        become a part of, while also addressing the unique requirements of
